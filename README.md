# React Ideas Page

This project is a React-based web page that displays a list of "ideas" fetched from a remote API. It features pagination, sorting, lazy loading of images, and persists user preferences (page, sort order, items per page) across page refreshes.

## Features

*   **Data Fetching:** Fetches idea data from the `https://suitmedia-backend.suitdev.com/api/ideas` API.
*   **Pagination:** Implements pagination to handle large datasets, allowing users to navigate through pages of ideas.
*   **Sorting:** Allows users to sort ideas by "Newest" or "Oldest" based on the `published_at` date.
*   **Show Per Page:** Users can select the number of items to display per page (10, 20, or 50).
*   **State Persistence:** Maintains user preferences for page, sort order, and items per page using `localStorage`, so these settings are preserved across page refreshes.
*   **Lazy Loading:** Uses `react-lazy-load-image-component` for efficient image loading, improving performance by loading images only when they are about to become visible in the viewport.
*   **Image Error Handling:** Includes error handling for images that fail to load, displaying a placeholder instead.
*   **Consistent Card Layout:** Ensures all idea cards have consistent dimensions, regardless of the original image sizes, using CSS `object-fit`.
*   **Date Formatting:** Formats the `published_at` date into a user-friendly format (e.g., "20 JULI 2024").
*   **Responsive Design:** Uses CSS Grid for a responsive card layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
* **Scroll to Top Button:** Implements a floating button that smoothly scrolls the user back to the top of the page.
* **Dynamic Title:** Uses `react-helmet` to dynamically update the page title.
